zf-quick-start-improved
======================

This takes the standard Zend Framework (ZF) quick start tutorial and improves it with some extras I found from using ZF over the last few years.

It was created with ZF 1.11.11 but should be compatible with future and past versions with a little modification. 

It includes among other things:

- Configuration/settings & bootstrap improvements
- Improved error handling and logging
- Database advice
- Form improvements
- HTML5
- Used baseUrl to allow flexibility of where the project is located (i.e. it now works in a sub folder)
- Made better use of this->url

and much more.

For more on what is different from the regular Zend Framework Quick Start tutorial take a look at Readme.pdf. 
It is a bit of a rough guide and it will be improved when I blog about it soon.

Enjoy.
